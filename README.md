## My Portfolio

Check out [My Portfolio here] (https://taflor.github.io/Education-Portfolio/). This portfolio contains past projects, experience, and information about my experience in programming and education.

My passion lies in the world of education - both for myself and others. I wish to continue this lifelong journey by entering into a career in education and from there, continuing on to grad school. Feel free to check out my portfolios!
