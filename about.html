        <p>
            Tiffany is a Social Media and Online Presence Coordinator, 
            as well as a children's fitness instructor, with experience 
            in team management, strategic planning, and teaching. 
            Her background in leadership, computer science, and education 
            contribute to her balanced approach and desire to experiment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tiffany's passion for education is demonstrated in her ongoing 
            studies of technology - Blockchain and web development - and of 
            learning accomodations and improvements for future generations. 
            She not only enjoys continuing her education, but she also has 
            a dream of inspiring joy and excitement of learning for all so 
            that every human may play a role in improving this world and their lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            Her desire to travel the world and open her mind to life outside 
            of the US encouraged her to move to Hong Kong upon graduating from 
            Eckerd College. There she was employed by an intnernational school 
            as a co-teacher and within 6 months, was promoted to co-teacher coordinator. 
            Here she developed her skills in leadership, education, and communication. 
        </p>
        <p>
            While overseas, Tiffany tackled her bucket list of backpacking through Asia. 
            She visited over 10 countries, trekked to the base camp of Mt. Everest, and 
            attended a yoga immersion course in Nepal, earning her yoga instructor certification. 
            Tiffany's adventures had a profound impact on exposing her passion for education 
            and technology. As she noticed the dwindling improvements in education curriculum 
            and the exponential growth and reach of technology, she vowed to fight for transforming 
            the education system, the beliefs surrounding education, and the use of technology as 
            a tool to stimulate engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tiffany is currently working for Bredenberg Associates - an organizational leadership 
            development company - operating along the East Coast. In January 2018, she is moving 
            to Memphis, TN where she is seeking a career in education and/or in technology. Reach
